# Bootstrap5-Theme

This is my first frontend project developed in Bootstrap 5 and CSS. It has a login page, a user registration page and a page with a list of all registered users. Also, I created a collapsible side menu containing the navigation links. All pages are responsive for different screen sizes.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS and Bootstrap
3. JavaScript and Jquery

## Customize

In the file `styles.css`, under `:root` you can change the colors according to the existing variables.
